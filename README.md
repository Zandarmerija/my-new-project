# AI-Powered Mental Health Chatbot

## Final Project for the Building AI Course

## Summary
An AI-powered chatbot designed to provide mental health support by offering immediate, empathetic responses and guiding users to appropriate resources. The chatbot uses natural language processing to understand user emotions and provide tailored advice.

---

## Background
Mental health issues affect millions of people worldwide, yet many struggle to access immediate help due to stigma, lack of resources, or long waiting times for professional support. AI-powered chatbots can help bridge this gap by offering real-time emotional support and resource recommendations.

The motivation behind this project is to leverage AI to provide a non-judgmental, accessible, and supportive platform for individuals who need someone to talk to. While AI cannot replace professional mental health care, it can serve as a first step in helping users navigate their emotions and seek appropriate help when necessary.

## Data and AI Techniques
This chatbot uses:

- **Pre-trained conversational AI model:** DialoGPT (Microsoft)
- **Sentiment Analysis:** VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner)
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** Transformers library by Hugging Face
- **Resource Matching:** A database of mental health resources, matched based on detected sentiment

The chatbot analyzes user input for emotional tone and generates responses accordingly. If a user expresses negative emotions, the bot provides empathetic messages and suggests helpful mental health resources.

---

## How is it Used?
Users interact with the chatbot via a simple command-line interface. The chatbot is intended for anyone experiencing stress, anxiety, or needing emotional support. The main users include:

- Individuals looking for emotional support
- People needing mental health resources
- Those who feel uncomfortable reaching out to others but still want to talk

## Example conversation with the Mental Health Chatbot
Welcome to the Mental Health Chatbot. Type 'exit' to end the conversation.
You: I've been feeling really stressed lately.
Chatbot: I'm really sorry to hear that you're feeling this way. Let's talk more about it.
Chatbot: I'm here for you. It sounds like you're going through a tough time. How can I help?
Chatbot: Here's a resource that might help: National Suicide Prevention Lifeline: 1-800-273-TALK (8255)
You: I don't know what to do.
Chatbot: That sounds tough. How can I help? Sometimes talking about it can help. Let's talk more about it.
You: exit
Chatbot: Take care of yourself. Remember, you're not alone. Goodbye!

## Challenges
- **Not a Replacement for Professional Help:** The chatbot cannot diagnose or treat mental illnesses.
- **Bias in AI Models:** AI models may generate responses that are not always appropriate due to training data limitations.
- **Privacy Concerns:** Users should be aware that their interactions are not stored, but AI models process input text.
- **Understanding Complex Emotions:** AI struggles to fully comprehend deep emotional nuances and may generate generic responses.

## What Next?
To improve the chatbot, future work could include:

- Expanding language support beyond English.
- Improving sentiment analysis for better emotional detection.
- Integrating voice input for accessibility.
- Developing a web-based or mobile interface for a smoother user experience.
- Connecting users with real mental health professionals for more serious cases.
